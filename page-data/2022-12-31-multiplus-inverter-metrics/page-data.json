Originally, I just had one hooked up and kept the other as a backup - I\nhave semi-critical loads like a freezer that would be wasteful/costly in the event of a prolonged outage. However, recently our winter charging needs dictated\nthat charging faster via the generator was in order - this provides extra flexibility, keeps the noise down for our neighbors, and <del>I suspect</del> yields better\ngenerator efficiency (more on that in another post). Thus for me, hooking up the second Multi was an obvious next step.</p>\n<p>This post will describe some things I have learned about the Multi's data protocols and how I've been using them to monitor our generator usage.</p>\n<p>Originally, I had a very simple script to pull data using a library Victron references in their\n<a href=\"https://www.victronenergy.com/live/open_source:start#multis_quattros_mk2\">open source link-farm</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/izak/ib.victron\">izak/ib.victron</a>\n(izak/ib.victron hereafter). It's not clear if that library is still being maintained and it has some other issues - e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/izak/ib.victron/pull/3\">still on Python\n2</a>, only supports a single bus device properly, and makes a few assumptions which break with the current version of\nthe protocol. I don't want to beat up on that library too much because it served me well for a year and helped me understand the protocol immensely. Just that\nmy use-case outgrew it. In addition to sharing what I've learned here, I hope to eventually share the library I've written as a spiritual successor to\nizak/ib.victron.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Victron puts their protocol documentation behind an email form so I can't share a direct link, but the relevant documentation can be found quite\neasily by requesting \"Interfacing with VE Bus products - MK2 protocol\" from <a href=\"https://www.victronenergy.com/support-and-downloads/technical-information\">Victron's Technical information downloads\npage</a>. The rest of this post will reference version 3.14 of that documentation,\nhowever I will try to provide enough detail so having that documentation in-hand isn't essential.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bus-vs-device-communication\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bus-vs-device-communication\" aria-label=\"bus vs device communication permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bus vs Device Communication</h3>\n<p>Multi's (and some other Victron devices) have RJ45 ports (the same physical ports used for ethernet) which are used to chain one or more devices together into\na single physical communication \"bus\". This bus (VE.Bus) is used by the devices themselves to coordinate parallel/split-phase/multi-phase operation and by\nmonitoring/control hardware/software. In order to access the bus from a computer, a special USB adapter (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y5WS3VZ/\">MK3-USB</a>) is\nused to translate between the bus transport and expose it as a serial interface.</p>\n<p>On the software side, Victron calls the protocol for interfacing with the bus \"MK2\". Messages in the MK2 protocol are called \"frames\". Most of these messages\ntake the form of a command/response pattern where devices wait for frames which request information or make changes, then respond with the requested\ninformation or confirmation/errors. There are two broad categories of commands, commands which pertain to the bus as a whole, and \"Winmon\" commands which\npertain to specific devices only.</p>\n<p>The izak/ib.victron library mainly only exposes the bus-level information. Interestingly, a lot of the bus-level information can't be interpreted without also\nrequesting supporting data from the individual bus devices. The rational for this doesn't seem to be documented in the protocol. Nor does it seem to be\ndocumented whether, in systems with several Multis, it is valid to use the supporting data from the first device to interpret the the bus-level information for\nall the devices - we kind of have to assume so, but it feels like a major gap in the protocol documentation.</p>\n<p>Another gap in the protocol documentation seems to be in terms of the meaning of parts of the bus-level information when multiple devices are hooked up.\nSpecifically, I was interested in the steady-state power cost of having two inverters hooked up all the time. With one inverter, I had been monitoring the DC\npower usage as as measured by the inverter and it seemed to match up with the baseline power usage for my system as a whole. When I hooked up the second\ninverter though, I was puzzled since that bus-level power usage number didn't appear to double. I still can't totally explain that phenomena (I will touch on\nthe phenomena in a later section to describe what I do know, but - as I say - it's still unexplained.) It is that quandary that sent me down the path of\ntrying to monitor the DC power usage for each inverter independently.</p>\n<p>In the MK2 protocol, there is a bus-level address command which is used to set or retrieve the address of the device to which subsequent Winmon commands are\ndirected. The izak/ib.victron library allows an address to be specified, but only once and only one address. It doesn't allow switching between devices on the\nfly and although it provides a primitive locking mechanism which would appear to allow multiple instances to work with the same bus, there isn't any logic\nto track which device is currently being addressed so it isn't really viable to use as-is for sending Winmon commands to multiple bus devices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"device-discovery\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#device-discovery\" aria-label=\"device discovery permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Device Discovery</h3>\n<p>The MK2 documentation also describes how to discover which devices are on the bus. This is done by iteratively selecting addresses and testing whether a\nresponse is received when issuing a Winmon command. The izak/ib.victron library doesn't handle this at all.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the MK2 protocol documentation doesn't clarify whether the result of this device discovery should be assumed to be valid for the entire life\nof a bus connection. In the case of my inverters I'm assuming so - since they're set up to switch as a group, meaning they can't be disconnected without\ninterrupting all the devices and I don't have any more VE.Bus devices to connect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"device-ram-snapshots\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#device-ram-snapshots\" aria-label=\"device ram snapshots permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Device RAM Snapshots</h3>\n<p>The MK2 protocol documentation suggests that, to get accurate point-in-time power data, one can issue a bus-level command to snapshot up to 6 specific RAM\nvariables, then read the data from that snapshot on each device. The available RAM IDs appear to correspond pretty closely to data that is also available via\nthe bus-level info commands, but the mapping between the two isn't explicitly described in the documentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poorly-documented-ram-variables\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#poorly-documented-ram-variables\" aria-label=\"poorly documented ram variables permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Poorly Documented RAM Variables</h3>\n<p>Along similar lines, some of the RAM variables have cryptic or misleading descriptions.

In my\ninstallation, this value is always zero or less, indicating power flowing from my generator to charge the batteries and power loads. I don't know whether there\nare scenarios where a positive value is possible, but we can surmise it might indicate power flowing back to mains - perhaps where power is being feed back to\nthe grid.</p>\n<p>I included \"vainv\" (the product of <code class=\"language-text\">RAM[2] * RAM[3]</code>) and \"wbat\" (the product of <code class=\"language-text\">RAM[4] * RAM[5]</code>) for comparison. I suspect the small differences where vainv\nis always a little higher than \"invpow\" (<code class=\"language-text\">RAM[14]</code>) are the result of my loads' power factor being slightly less than one - the three RAM values were captured\nas part of the same snapshot. Similarly, the difference between the inverter power and \"wbat\" should show us the overhead or self-consumption of the inverter.</p>\n<p>Finally, \"outpow\" (<code class=\"language-text\">RAM[16]</code>) is pretty self-explanatory. It is just the power actually used by loads on the AC output of the Multis and does not seem to\neffected by whether the inverter hardware is charging or inverting.

After much experimenting with the metrics side of things, I finally decided to stick a clamp ammeter on the cable to the inverter and\nfound around 0.95 amps @ 26.5v DC with zero load - literally nothing connected to the output. Since that didn't appear in any of the metrics, I next tested with\na known load by putting a 40 watt incandescent light bulb directly on the terminals. Immediately, the Multi started reporting that it was consuming 69 watts from\nthe battery which is much more like what I was expecting. Thus in my present configuration it appears the second Multi has an idle power draw in the range of 30\nwatts, but has trouble self-reporting that usage unless there is also some AC load current flowing.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 690px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d47d42f0cc082075f62e61e5d6786da5/e24fe/inverter-self-consumption.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.33526011560693%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAIAAADwazoUAAAACXBIWXMAAAgnAAAZhwGkFvs+AAAA3klEQVQoz32Qa2oDMQyE9w5r6zGyZHu3/Vna+5+u2KFJSNaFDyEYiRlpE0RmrGBGoqW6sRYSEL8hUPfijghWy6wvA2NZLUhshQp4IY1lQVzY3oIRmEbNYpcDI/bqJMAcUIBELy/f1Ooqs5mFWURYiZvHa+x/nBOBshznx9f3T7S+k+a583AW+Pj2AmGwQs1ZMJ0fTGd4Yk2s+a/eoFmFNJMmukvP0XQr0frRWq+t12M20epx1vOzqwXggqhtqHXOjKZF6+FRN1bz2lGilPDa5mMlk+wkiWTPg0xP8L3XX31nQA/RG1PpAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Inverter Self-consumption Graph\"\n        title=\"Inverter Self-consumption Graph\"\n        src=\"/static/d47d42f0cc082075f62e61e5d6786da5/1e043/inverter-self-consumption.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d47d42f0cc082075f62e61e5d6786da5/991de/inverter-self-consumption.png 173w,\n/static/d47d42f0cc082075f62e61e5d6786da5/e4d6b/inverter-self-consumption.png 345w,\n/static/d47d42f0cc082075f62e61e5d6786da5/1e043/inverter-self-consumption.png 690w,\n/static/d47d42f0cc082075f62e61e5d6786da5/e3189/inverter-self-consumption.png 1035w,\n/static/d47d42f0cc082075f62e61e5d6786da5/e24fe/inverter-self-consumption.png 1073w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I will probably work around this discrepancy in the future by just shifting some of my loads on to the other split-phase leg and then not worry about it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"monitoring-generator-usage\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#monitoring-generator-usage\" aria-label=\"monitoring generator usage permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Monitoring Generator Usage</h3>\n<p>For a while now I've been tracking my generator usage. This helps me understand the ongoing costs of my off-grid system. Some interesting efficiency data has\ncome out of that which will probably be the subject of another post, but the part I want to discuss here is the actual monitoring mechanism because that is based\non the metrics from the Multis and my learnings above.</p>\n<p>In my system all generator power flows through the Multis which charge the batteries and also pass power through to my AC loads. There are several advantages to\nthis configuration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It eliminates the need for a transfer switch since the Multis can do that internally - seamlessly switching from inverter to pass-through modes as needed</li>\n<li>The Multis can automatically manage the max generator current such that the charging rate is attenuated when large loads come on</li>\n<li>The Multis provide a common point where many of the key usage metrics can be measured</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To that last point, I can then have a tiny service which utilizes the learnings above to poll the Multis and write the relevant metrics into InfluxDB. Those\nraw metrics are available in a dashboard, but also are available for analysis purposes. In this case, I have a script which reads the data from InfluxDB and\noutputs the generator run time and kWh produced for each instance the generator is run.</p>\n<p>I'll probably share the actual code for doing that in a future post, but for now, I'll just outline how it works. The script pulls 1 minute data for the last week\nand looks for datapoints where the inverter is charging instead of drawing power from the batteries. For those time periods it tracks the total runtime and sums\nthe 1 minute averages of the power used to charge and power passing through to the loads.</p>\n<p>The resulting data can help with understanding the generator's performance characteristics - i.e. at what average loading do we get the most kWh per unit of\ngenerator fuel. It also is a convenient way to track generator run hours which is useful for scheduling maintenance tasks like oil changes and filter cleaning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I don't know what the ideal intersection is for open source/knowledge with proprietary upper-mid-teir hardware like Victron. Clearly, there is an argument for\nVictron funding more first-party open source tooling and improving their documentation to disambiguate some of the points that I've highlighted above. At\nthe same time I appreciate that there exists <em>some</em> documentation, and admire the scrappy nature of the community open source projects they've linked to.</p>\n<p>I hope that this post is helpful to others who want to gain access to detailed inverter metrics and attain a deeper understanding of the behaviour their systems.\nPerhaps it will inspire people to share their learnings and library improvements.</p>\n<p>More generally, I am optimistic that the sum of the broader hacker/tinkerer communities' efforts with various alternative/renewable/off-grid energy systems and\ncomponents will yield a more robust and adaptable technical ecosystem. That in turn could allow folks to build systems they can afford and which reward\nconserving resources. Acknowledging of course that in many/(most?) cases, if available, standard grid power will probably be the cleanest and cheapest option\noverall.</p>\n<p>Happy New Year and happy/safe hacking!</p>","timeToRead":9,"excerpt":"I am lucky enough to have a pair of Victron MultiPlus inverters (Multi(s) hereafter).
